# Arbitrary-Precision-Calculator


# Introduction:
	Arbitrary-precision arithmetic, also called bignum arithmetic, multiple precision arithmetic, or sometimes infinite-precision arithmetic, indicates that calculations are performed on numbers whose digits of precision are limited only by the available memory of the host system. This contrasts with the faster fixed-precision arithmetic found in most arithmetic logic unit (ALU) hardware, which typically offers between 8 and 64 bits of precision.

# Applications of APC:
1) A common application is public-key cryptography, whose algorithms commonly employ arithmetic with integers having hundreds of digits.
2) Arbitrary precision arithmetic is also used to compute fundamental mathematical constants such as Ï€ to millions or more digits.


# Requirements:
1) User will enter two big numbers along with the operator in the terminal. Say e.g: x+y, where x and y are very large numbers
2) Application will perform the operation based on the user input and display the result.
